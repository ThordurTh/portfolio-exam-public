                <div class="basic_text">
                    <p>The theme Basic Web revolved around learning the basics of HTML and CSS and Adobe Photoshop,
                        Illustrator
                        and
                        Xd. It included three main assignments which became increasingly difficult with each one having
                        additional
                        requirements. </p>
                    <p>The usage of proper semantic HTML became the first topic since it is the structure of every
                        webpage.
                        It
                        didn't take very long to get a good grasp of the markup language but the same can not be said of
                        CSS.
                    </p>
                    <p>Changing colours and positioning elements are the basic tools of CSS and fairly easy to
                        understand.
                        But
                        styling a webpage can get much more complicated than that. </p>
                    <p>The basics of Photoshop, Illustrator and Xd are also important to know since it is the web
                        designer's
                        “holy
                        trinity”.
                        Editing images in Ps, creating logos in Ai and designing whole webpages in Xd. </p>
                </div>

            <section id="russian">
                <h2>Russian <br>Constructivism</h2>
                <div class="russian_text">
                    <p>The first assignment had its focus on using the correct semantic HTML tags and gestalt laws.
                        It also taught me the approach of designing for mobile first which has become a standard in web
                        development. </p>
                    <p>I decided to make a simple and straight-forward design. Its colour scheme is based on works from
                        the
                        Russian Constructivism era and fonts are without decorations (sans-serif) to underline the
                        movement.
                    </p>

                </div>
            </section>
            <!--russian ENDS-->

            <section id="micro">
                <h2>The History of
                    the Micro Computer</h2>
                <div class="micro_text">
                    <p>The second one expanded on the previous requirements but as a desktop view only with the help of
                        css
                        grid. </p>
                    <p>Like the previous assignment, the overall design is quite simple. Only three colours are present
                        to
                        mimic
                        old computer monitors. The background is light brown for the outer shell and each section has a
                        grey
                        background and bright green font to mimic the screen. I also opted to use my own single-colour
                        vector
                        graphics instead of images since early monitors couldn’t display a variety of colours. </p>

            <section id="interest">
                <h2>Interest-based Website</h2>
                <div class="interest_text">
                    <p>The third one was the toughest one, with all the prior knowledge being put to use, with the
                        addition
                        of
                        making the website responsive. A specific design style also had to be followed and the whole
                        content
                        written by myself. </p>
                    <p>I decided to make the website follow a minimalistic design. A bone-white background, grey font
                        and a
                        nintendo-red to emphasise the topic. The website has more advanced grid system than the previous
                        assignment which became quite tricky to make responsive. I opted to use my own vector graphics
                        again
                        but
                        this time for simplicity and a “blue print” kind of style.</p>
