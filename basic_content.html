                    <p>This theme had its focus on plan, shoot and edit a video for a client’s website and making
                        changes to the client’s website in relation to colours, typography, logo and overall style in
                        cohesion with the video presented.
                    </p>
                    <p>To achieve that was it essential to learn how to take notes from the client’s debrief and address
                        problems, know how to plan and shoot a video using different techniques and editing in Adobe
                        Premier or an equivalent program. The final product should provide the client with a more
                        beneficial website.

                    <p>Before we had a debrief with the client, were we taught how to make a short video. The
                        requirements was that it told a story without words in a minute and showed that we planned, shot
                        and edited accordingly. I grouped up with a classmate to make a video about a missing rabbit. We
                        made a
                        storyboard and planned every shot and its location. It was a great practise for the main
                        assignment to come.</p>

                <div class="treatment_text">
                    <p>We formed groups of 5 after the client’s debrief and began comparing our notes. The client runs
                        the “Free Fridge” project where anyone can donate and/or take food from a public fridge. The
                        client mentioned a few problems that they had been dealing with such as, struggling to get
                        volunteers and spreading the word. We wanted to tackle those by making a video that shows how
                        easy it is to help others in need.
                    </p>
                    <p>It starts out by having 4 people opening a fridge at the same time. 3 of them in their homes,
                        take something out while the last one at the free fridge, closes it empty handed. A few moments
                        later can those 3 people be seen walking towards the free fridge with vegetables in their hands
                        to the 4th person’s joy.</p>

                    <p>We made a storyboard which shows each shot, its location, camera transtition, and description. We
                        originally had 15 shots in mind but it got reduced to 13 in the editing process. It became
                        really helpful to use it as a guide while shooting to make sure nothing was forgotten. </p>
